In 1995 the ZKA announced a common online banking standard called *Homebanking Computer Interface* (HBCI). In 2003 they published the next generation of this protocol standard and named it *Financial Transaction Services* (FinTS).

Today most of all german banks support this online banking standards.

The Electronic Banking Internet Communication Standard (EBICS) is a German transmission protocol developed by the German Banking Industry Committee for sending payment information between banks over the Internet. It grew out of the earlier BCS-FTAM protocol that was developed in 1995, with the aim of being able to use internet connections and TCP/IP. It is mandated for use by German banks and has also been adopted by France and Switzerland. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Banking_Internet_Communication_Standard).
